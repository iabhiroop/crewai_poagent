## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application
- **Backend**: Direct integration with CrewAI agents and tools
- **Databases**: SQLite (inventory), MongoDB (orders), JSON (queues)
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs

### Data Sources
- **Inventory Data**: SQLite database (`inventory.db`)
- **Purchase Queue**: JSON file (`purchase_queue.json`)
- **Supplier Orders**: MongoDB collection (`poagent_db.PO_records`)

### Real-time Updates
The dashboard connects directly to your data sources and provides real-time views of:
- Current inventory levels and status
- Purchase request queue status
- Incoming supplier orders
- System health and connectivity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No inventory data found"**
- Make sure the main system has been run at least once to initialize the database
- Click "Initialize Sample Inventory" if needed

**"Could not connect to MongoDB"**
- Ensure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
- Check if the `poagent_db` database exists

**"Email Config Warning"**
- Set up environment variables for email configuration
- Check the main system's `.env` file

**Import errors**
- Ensure the main CrewAI system is properly installed
- Check that all dependencies are installed in both environments

### System Requirements
- **Memory**: 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 500MB free space
- **Network**: Internet connection for AI models
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
